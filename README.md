This project contains code to accompany the paper [1]. The code is for computing 
quadrature based approximants to operator convex and operator monotone functions.
This is done using an implementation of the weighted differential algorithm, 
using adaptive barycentric representations of rational functions inspired by [2].

See the [example.ipynb](example.ipynb) notebook for example usage.
